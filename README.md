# Sierpinski_triangles
A simple project written to gain some practice in SDL and OpenGL. This program draws Sierpinski triangles fractal using three methods:
1) Drawing new triangles inside previous ones recursively
2) Using & operator on x and y coordinates of a every pixel
3) Using random function to approximate the Sierpinski triangles

Program is written using C++98.
